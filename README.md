## Project created for Logistic Tech Challenge organized and hosted by [Intelipost](https://www.intelipost.com.br/)
In July 2018, the 1st edition of the Intelipost Logistics Tech Challenge happened in SÃ£o Paulo!

Organized by Intelipost, in partnership with Oracle Brasil and Abralog, 50 participants had been selected for a 2-day event in Hackathon format, for developing a solutions using Blockchain technology for logistics.

### Technical approach
The project has been developed using Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger composer. The network is build on top of a swarn network for being able to have 3 nodes running on different places.<br/>
##### Script approach: <br/>
`build.sh`<br/> 
This script will generate crypto and channel artifacts necessary for creating the network. It will also create a toSendAfterBuild folder containing those artifacts for other node to be able to start their corresponding docker container. (don't forget to change BIN_DIR to your corresponding path)<br/><br/>
`startFabric_x.sh`<br/> 
Script to start docker container.<br/><br/>
`initIdentityAndChainCode_1.sh`<br/>
This script create all the identities and instantiate the smart contract on node 1, 2 & 3. It has been created for instantiating everything from node 1. When executed it will create a toSendAfterIdentityCreation folder to send to peer 2 & 3 containing admin identity card. `initIdentityAndChainCode_2.sh` & `initIdentityAndChainCode_3.sh` are just for importing the card created by `initIdentityAndChainCode_1.sh` and placed in toSendAfterIdentityCreation.

### Create swarm<br/>
Initialize swarm manager on PC1:<br/>
`docker swarm init --advertise-addr 192.168.1.31` (in terminal get your ip: ip addr  => should show inet 192.168.1.31)<br/>
After tipping the command it will show you something similar as `docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-1ymnwhc93p9hp8hyu3m1fb7p64alnvhbm1h5howee3755idwuo-0j5bj0jcrswbskl92vmi8eu3x 192.168.1.31` <br/><br/>


On PC2, PC3: Join the swarm as worker by coping the command showed after swarm init:<br/>
`docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-1ymnwhc93p9hp8hyu3m1fb7p64alnvhbm1h5howee3755idwuo-0j5bj0jcrswbskl92vmi8eu3x 192.168.1.31`<br/><br/>


Create docker network <br/>
`docker network create --attachable --driver overlay my-net`<br/>

Open Port on your different host <br/>
`sudo ufw allow 2377/tcp && sudo ufw allow 7946/tcp && sudo ufw allow 7946/udp && sudo ufw allow 4789/udp`<br/>
(TCP port 2377 for cluster management communications, TCP and UDP port 7946 for communication among nodes UDP port 4789 for overlay network traffic)

### Mount the project<br/>
1. Build the config `build.sh`
2. Send file created in folder toSendAfterBuild to host 2 & 3
3. Start `startFabric_1.sh` in host1, start `StartFabric_2.sh` in host 2, `StartFabric_3.sh` in host 3
4. Create the identity and chaincode instantiation by executing `initIdentityAndChainCode_1.sh` in host 1
5. Send the card created in folder toSendAfterIdentityCreation to corresponding host and copy it in the same folder as `initIdentityAndChainCode_x.sh`
6. Start `initIdentityAndChainCode_2.sh` in host 2, `initIdentityAndChainCode_3.sh` in host 3
