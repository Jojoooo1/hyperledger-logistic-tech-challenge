## Project created for Logistic Tech Challenge organized by [Intelipost](https://www.intelipost.com.br/)
In July 2018, the 1st edition of the Intelipost Logistics Tech Challenge happened in SÃ£o Paulo!

Organized by Intelipost, in partnership with Oracle Brasil and Abralog, 50 participants had been selected for a 2-day event in Hackathon format, for developing a solutions using Blockchain technology for logistics.

### Technical approach
The project has been developed using Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger composer. The network is build on top of a swarn network for being able to have 3 nodes running on different places.<br/><br/>
Script approach: <br/>
`build.sh`: Change bin path to your corresponding path.<br/> 
This script will generate crypto and channel artifacts necessary for creating the network. It will also create a toSendAfterBuild folder containing those artifacts for other node to be able to start their corresponding docker container.<br/>
`startFabric_x.sh` contain the script to start docker container.<br/>
`initIdentityAndChainCode_x.sh` will create all the identity to participate to the network and also instantiate the smart contract on node 2 & 3. It has been created for instantiating everything from node 1. When executed it will create a toSendAfterIdentityCreation folder to send to peer 2 & 3 containing admin identity card.

### Step to create the network
Create swarm:
On PC1: initialize the host as manager
	docker swarm init --advertise-addr 192.168.1.31 (in terminal get your ip: ip addr  => should show inet 192.168.1.31)

On PC2: join the swarm as worker
docker swarm join --token ************************************** 

Create network:
docker network create --attachable --driver overlay my-net

Open Port on your different host:
sudo ufw allow 2377/tcp && sudo ufw allow 7946/tcp && sudo ufw allow 7946/udp && sudo ufw allow 4789/udp

(TCP port 2377 for cluster management communications, TCP and UDP port 7946 for communication among nodes UDP port 4789 for overlay network traffic)

1. Build the config `build.sh`
2. Send file created in folder toSendAfterBuild to corresponding host
3. Start `startFabric_1.sh` in host1 
4. Start `StartFabric_2.sh` in host 2, `StartFabric_3.sh` in host 3
5. Create the identity and chaincode instantiation by executing `initIdentityAndChainCode_1.sh`
6. Send the card created in folder toSendAfterIdentityCreation to corresponding host and copy it in the same folder as `initIdentityAndChainCode_x.sh`
7. Start `initIdentityAndChainCode_2.sh` in host 2, `initIdentityAndChainCode_3.sh` in host 3
